<h3>Footwork Drills</h3>
<p>We help you prefect your footwork by working through various levels of training that hone in on and advance your current abilities.

Footwork is a crucial element of boxing, and with personalized lessons you will improve your agility and begin to “move like a butterfly” as Ali would say.</p>
<h3>Bag Work</h3>
<p>More than just punching a bag until you no longer can, our personal trainer will walk you through the correct way to hit and execute your punches by using a boxing bag. Not only does this increase your ability to make contact with laser like precision, but it will also improve your fitness level as it incorporates cardio into your training. With us you will learn professional techniques that improve your current abilities and clean up what you already know.</p>
<h3>Pad work</h3>
<p>Our pad work training puts you toe-to-toe with our trainers who will teach you the correct techniques for boxing in a professional format. From teaching you how to move correctly, to improving your stance and your punching technique, your personal trainer will walk you through the steps of pad work until you master this aspect of boxing.  Pad work also involves footwork, so be ready for a bit of cardio along the way.</p>
<h3>Core training</h3>
<p>Core training strengthens your core which is primarily your back and your stomach. Our trainers will show you various floor exercises that improve your ability to move on and off the mat. Core training also improves your fitness levels and helps you lose weight.</p>
